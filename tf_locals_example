# Speculative Destroy: 
it refers to a simulated destruction plan that allows users to see the potential effects of destroying infrastructure resources without actually performing the destruction. The primary purpose of a speculative destroy plan is to provide a preview of what resources would be removed if a terraform destroy command were executed. This is crucial for understanding the impact of such an action and preventing accidental or unintended deletions of critical infrastructure.

# How to avoid destroying a specific resource: 
To avoid destroying a specific resource in Terraform, the primary method is to use the prevent_destroy lifecycle meta-argument within the resource block.
Using prevent_destroy:
Locate the resource block in your Terraform configuration (.tf file) that defines the resource you wish to protect from destruction.
Add a lifecycle block within that resource block.
Inside the lifecycle block, set prevent_destroy = true

    resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      lifecycle {
        prevent_destroy = true
      }
    }
