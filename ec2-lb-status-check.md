## üñ•Ô∏è EC2 Status Checks
EC2 instances have two types of status checks to help you monitor their health:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ System Status Check
What it checks: The underlying hardware and AWS infrastructure.
Examples:
Loss of network connectivity
Hardware issues
Power or software issues on the host machine
If it fails: You may need to stop/start the instance or contact AWS support.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Instance Status Check
What it checks: The operating system and software inside your EC2 instance.
Examples:
Failed boot process
OS-level issues (e.g., kernel panic)
Exhausted memory or disk
If it fails: You may need to reboot, fix the OS, or check logs.
üåê Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Health Checks
ELBs (Classic, ALB, NLB) use health checks to monitor the status of registered targets (like EC2 instances).

## üîç Types of Health Checks
HTTP/HTTPS: ELB sends a request to a specific path (e.g., /health) and expects a 200 OK response.
TCP: ELB checks if it can establish a TCP connection on a specified port.
gRPC (for ALB): Checks gRPC health status.

## üîÑ Health Check States
Healthy: Target responds correctly.
Unhealthy: Target fails health checks repeatedly.
Initial: Target is in the process of being checked.
Draining: Target is being deregistered.

## üñ•Ô∏è EC2 Status Checks: 2/2
When you see 2/2 checks passed for an EC2 instance, it means:

‚úÖ Both EC2 health checks have passed:
System Status Check ‚Äì AWS infrastructure is healthy.
Instance Status Check ‚Äì The OS inside the instance is healthy.
üîπ If you see 1/2 or 0/2, it means one or both checks have failed, and the instance may not be functioning properly.

## üåê ELB Health Checks: 3/3 (or N/N)
For Elastic Load Balancers, the health check status is often shown as X/X, where:

X = Number of consecutive successful health checks required to mark a target as healthy.
For example, 3/3 means the target passed 3 consecutive checks and is now considered healthy.
Example:
If your health check config is:
Healthy threshold = 3
Unhealthy threshold = 2
Then:
3/3 = Healthy
0/3, 1/3, 2/3 = Still checking
0/2 = Unhealthy

| Check                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                            
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **1. System Status Check**                              | Verifies that the **underlying AWS infrastructure** (e.g., hardware, network, power) is functioning properly.                                                                                                      |
| **2. Instance Status Check**                            | Confirms that the **OS on your EC2 instance** is responding to AWS. It checks the instance's network stack, software config, etc.                                                                                  |
| **3. Reachability Check** (sometimes optional/implicit) | Confirms that the instance can be reached via **network (e.g., SSH or HTTP)**. This may include Security Group and Route Table verification if you're using automated reachability checks (e.g., via ELB or CloudWatch).


## Load Balancer Health Check Working 
1. How It Works:-
Regular Monitoring: Load balancer sends periodic requests to registered targets (every 5-300 seconds)

2. Health Check Types:-

HTTP/HTTPS: Expects 200 OK response from specified path
TCP: Successful connection establishment
Threshold Logic:

Unhealthy: Fails 2-10 consecutive checks ‚Üí marked unhealthy
Healthy: Passes 2-10 consecutive checks ‚Üí marked healthy
Traffic Routing: Only healthy targets receive traffic

3. Key Parameters:

Protocol and port
Check interval (frequency)
Timeout duration
Health/unhealthy thresholds
Target path (for HTTP/HTTPS)

4. Quick Example:
Health check every 30 seconds
Timeout after 5 seconds
Mark unhealthy after 2 failed checks
Mark healthy after 3 successful checks
Check path: /health expecting 200 response

5. Result:
Automatic traffic distribution to only healthy instances
Failed instances automatically removed from rotation
Integration with Auto Scaling for instance replacement
